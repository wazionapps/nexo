# Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-31

### Breaking Changes
- Code and data separated: code in repo/NEXO_CODE, data in NEXO_HOME
- NEXO_HOME env var required (default ~/.nexo/)
- DB location: NEXO_HOME/data/nexo.db and cognitive.db
- Evolution config moved from cortex/ to brain/
- nexo-install.py deprecated (use npx nexo-brain)
- nexo-auto-update.py deprecated (auto-update built into server startup)

### Added
- Unified architecture: single source of code, personal data in NEXO_HOME
- Plugin loader: scans repo plugins/ then NEXO_HOME/plugins/ (personal override)
- Auto-update on startup: non-blocking (5s max), resilient, opt-out via schedule.json
- Auto-diary: 3-layer system (PostToolUse every 10 calls, PreCompact emergency, heartbeat DIARY_OVERDUE)
- CLAUDE.md version tracker: section markers for safe core updates without losing customizations
- schedule.json: customizable process schedules with timezone support
- All 15 processes auto-installed: watchdog, immune, synthesis, backup, catchup, cognitive-decay, postmortem, self-audit, sleep, deep-sleep, evolution, followup-hygiene, prevent-sleep, tcc-approve, auto-close-sessions
- All 7 hooks auto-installed: session-start, session-stop (postmortem), capture-tool-logs, inbox-hook, pre-compact, post-compact, session-timestamp
- prevent-sleep: cross-platform (caffeinate on macOS, systemd-inhibit on Linux)
- tcc-approve: auto-approve macOS permissions for Claude Code updates
- nexo_update MCP tool + nexo-update.sh standalone script
- Installer asks for data directory (NEXO_HOME) in 6 languages
- evolution-objective.json backfill for existing installs
- scripts/ backfill for existing installs
- Claude CLI calls hardened with --bare + real auth pre-check

### Fixed
- Lambda decay values were 24x too aggressive (STM: 7h→7d, LTM: 2.4d→60d)
- MCP instructions truncated (3458→1302 chars)
- Guard returned 35+ irrelevant blocking rules (now scoped to area, gated to high/critical)
- Recurring followup returned wrong ID and left FTS index inconsistent
- Server.py had side effects on import (now wrapped in _server_init + __main__)
- sqlite3 import missing in cognitive/_search.py
- Runtime-preflight, watchdog-smoke, self-audit referenced legacy cortex/ layout
- 12 rounds of external audit, ~60 findings resolved

### Changed
- All scripts use NEXO_HOME/NEXO_CODE env vars (auto-detect from repo location)
- All UI strings in English (NLP patterns retain bilingual keywords)
- README: honest credential storage description (was "secure")
- Single installer (nexo-brain.js), single update engine (auto_update.py)
- Dashboard: platform guard for osascript (returns 501 on Linux)

### Known Issues
- Credentials stored in plaintext SQLite (P0 for v2.1.0)
- Shell hooks use SQL interpolation (P0 for v2.1.0)
- Dashboard has no auth (localhost only, P0 for v2.1.0)
- Migrations are fail-open (P0 for v2.1.0)

## [1.8.0-beta.3] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **core_rules table missing**: Added migration M15 creating `core_rules` and `core_rules_version` tables. Plugin crashed on fresh install because tables were never created. Seeds version row for update tracking.
- **core_rules plugin hardened**: `_seed_if_empty()` now handles missing table gracefully instead of crashing.
- **Personal data sanitized**: Removed "Francisco" reference in `tools_sessions.py` comment. Migration script patterns marked as legacy with generic alternatives added.
- **Anti-duplicate followup restored**: `create_followup()` now calls `find_similar_followups()` before inserting and warns on potential duplicates (non-blocking).
- **Auto-resolve reporting restored**: `handle_change_commit()` now reports which followup IDs were auto-resolved in its return message.

## [1.8.0-beta.2] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed
- **Instructions truncation**: MCP instructions reduced from 3458 to 1302 chars. Previous version was silently truncated by Claude Code's system reminder injection, causing the last rules (Diary, Cortex, Change Log) to be lost.
- **Heartbeat param naming**: Instructions now show explicit parameter names (`sid=SID, task='...'`) instead of ambiguous "SID + task" which caused LLM parameter guessing errors.
- **Guard noise reduction**: Universal rules now scoped to matching area + nexo-ops (was: all learnings with NUNCA/SIEMPRE keywords). Blocking rules gated to high/critical priority only. Output caps: learnings max 10 (was 15), universal max 5 (was 10).

### Changed
- **Instructions format**: Dense bullets with explicit tool signatures instead of H3 prose sections. Same 11 rules, 62% fewer chars.

## [1.8.0-beta.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Tool-coupled behavioral rules moved from CLAUDE.md to the MCP server `instructions` field. Rules are now protocol-level, injected at the same priority as CLAUDE.md.
- **Migration script** (`migrate-v1.7-to-v1.8.py`): Automatically slims existing CLAUDE.md files by removing sections that are now MCP-owned. Idempotent with backup.
- **Expanded MCP instructions**: Heartbeat, Guard, Delegation, Reminders, Memory, Trust Score, Dissonance, Change Log, Session Diary, and Cortex rules now ship with the server.

### Changed
- **CLAUDE.md template**: 130 → 50 lines. Now contains only bootstrap (identity, profile, format, autonomy, project atlas, hooks). All tool-coupled rules removed.
- **Context token savings**: ~3K fewer tokens consumed per session by eliminating rule duplication between CLAUDE.md and MCP instructions.


## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Linux support**: systemd user timers (preferred) or crontab fallback for automated cognitive processes. Same 4 scheduled tasks as macOS LaunchAgents.
- **Auto-resolve followups**: Change log entries automatically cross-reference and complete matching open followups via file overlap, keyword similarity, and ID reference.
- **Find similar followups**: Duplicate detection before creating new followups using asymmetric keyword overlap scoring.
- **Free-form learning categories**: Removed hardcoded category validation. Users can now use any category name (e.g., 'backend', 'frontend', 'devops').

### Changed
- **Full internationalization**: All UI strings, error messages, labels, and DB status values translated to English. Status values: `PENDING`, `COMPLETED`, `DELETED` (previously Spanish).
- **CLAUDE.md template rewrite**: 494→127 lines. Compact, procedural format. Same capabilities, zero prose.
- **Complete sanitization**: Removed all personal data, hardcoded paths, and project-specific references from the entire codebase. Every file uses `NEXO_HOME` env var.
- **Deleted 48 macOS Finder duplicate files** ("file 2.ext" pattern).

### Fixed
- Syntax error in `nexo-evolution-run.py` from automated NEXO_HOME insertion.
- Hardcoded locale (Europe/Madrid, es_ES) in menu date formatting.
- Personal directory path in FTS code indexing configuration.

## [1.7.0-beta.1] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- **Migration system** (`nexo-migrate.py`): Automatic, idempotent upgrades between versions with backup-before-migrate and a versioned migration registry.
- **Install script** (`nexo-install.py`): First-time setup that creates `~/.nexo/` structure, initializes databases, copies repo files, and sets `NEXO_HOME` in shell profile.
- **Diary brief mode**: `nexo_session_diary_read` now accepts `brief=True` to return only the last entry's summary + mental_state + context_next (~1K chars) for fast startup.

### Changed
- **Heartbeat optimization** (8 ops down to 3): Removed sentiment detection, trust auto-detect, adaptive mode computation, RAG retrieval, and auto-prime from the heartbeat hot path. These cognitive features remain available on-demand via dedicated tools (`nexo_cognitive_sentiment`, `nexo_cognitive_trust`, `nexo_cognitive_retrieve`, `nexo_context_packet`).
- **Path standardization**: All files now use `NEXO_HOME` env var with `~/.nexo` fallback instead of hardcoded `~/claude` paths. Affected: `_fts.py`, `auto_close_sessions.py`, `nexo-watchdog.sh`, `nexo-deep-sleep.sh`, `nexo-postmortem-consolidator.py`, `dashboard/app.py`.

### Fixed
- Dashboard watchdog endpoint used `~/claude` as fallback instead of `~/.nexo`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- Artifact registry for tracking services, dashboards, scripts, and APIs.
- Session checkpoints for intelligent auto-compaction.
- Claude session ID linking for inter-terminal coordination.
- Learnings priority, weight, and guard usage tracking.
- Deep sleep analysis system with catch-up for missed days.
- Watchdog comprehensive health monitor (15+ services).
- Postmortem consolidator v2 with Claude CLI intelligence.

### Changed
- Episodic memory plugin expanded with diary archive (permanent subconscious memory).
- FTS5 unified search with cross-language synonyms and code file indexing.
